Tell me more about the AI Message Server project

# AI Response

As Echo's AI Message Center Assistant, I have access to the ECHO-MESSAGE-SERVER repository, which is the AI Message Server project. This project is a centralized message queue and task management system for Echo AI Systems. It stores client requests and conversations as markdown files for processing.

The AI Message Server project is used to manage messages and tasks for Echo AI Systems. It allows Echo to review and process messages, and to provide responses to clients. The project is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing it to handle a high volume of messages and tasks.

The ECHO-MESSAGE-SERVER repository contains the code and configuration files for the AI Message Server project. It includes files such as `config.json`, `message_queue.json`, and `task_manager.py`, which are used to configure and run the project.

If you have any specific questions about the AI Message Server project or would like to know more about how it works, feel free to ask!
