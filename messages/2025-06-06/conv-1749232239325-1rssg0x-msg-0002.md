# AI Response

I've received your request!

Here's the confirmation:

**Task:** Update the projects list to remove "self" projects and add Insulation Contractors of Arizona, including the separate website JSON memory file.

I will save this task for Echo to review later.

**Note:** Since you've mentioned "self" projects, I assume you mean projects that are internal to Echo AI Systems, such as the website (memvid), project agents (starter template), etc. I will make sure to remove those from the list.

I will also add Insulation Contractors of Arizona to the projects list, including the separate website JSON memory file.

To confirm, I'll access the GitHub repository and review the project list. Then, I'll update the list according to your request and save the changes in the ECHO-MESSAGE-SERVER repository.

Is there anything else I can assist you with?
