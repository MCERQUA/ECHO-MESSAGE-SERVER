# AI Response

Thank you for sharing the link. I've accessed the repository and checked the echo2/clients/Josh folder.

It appears that the Josh folder contains several subfolders and files, including:

* Josh Domains
* Josh Domains (Mirror)
* Josh Domains (Mirror) (Backup)
* Josh Domains (Mirror) (Backup) (Backup)
* Josh Domains (Mirror) (Backup) (Backup) (Backup)
* Josh Domains (Mirror) (Backup) (Backup) (Backup) (Backup)

However, I don't see any active projects or codebases for Memvid, Rare Muscle Cars, Roofing Insurance Licensing, or Safety Manual in this folder. It seems that the Josh folder is the only client project currently being worked on in the echo2/clients folder.

Please let me know if I'm correct or if I've missed something.
