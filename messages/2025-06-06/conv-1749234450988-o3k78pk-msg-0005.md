The `echo2/clients` folder contains several client projects, including:

1. **Memvid**: This folder contains the codebase for the Memvid project, which is a video-based AI memory system for efficient text storage and retrieval.
2. **Josh Domains**: This folder contains the codebase for the Josh Domains project, which is a domain management and website project for Josh.
3. **Rare Muscle Cars**: This folder contains the codebase for the Rare Muscle Cars project, which is a classic car showcase and marketplace website project.
4. **Roofing Insurance Licensing**: This folder contains the codebase for the Roofing Insurance Licensing project, which is a roofing contractor licensing and insurance management system project.
5. **Safety Manual**: This folder contains the codebase for the Safety Manual project, which is a digital safety manual and compliance system project.

These projects are actively being worked on and updated by Echo AI Systems.
